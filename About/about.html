        <h1 id="about">About Us:</h1>
        <p>     Here at Starks' Fantastic Creatures we pride ourselves on providing a safe, fun, and tolerant place to post, and
            rate your favorite fantasy/sci-fi creatures, characters, or people. A part of the same company that brought you
            the services of Starks Fantastic Pet Supply, we have a love of all creatures great and small, magical and non magical.
            We take our environment VERY seriously, and all those who threaten this place of fun and joy, will be subject to
            a "visit" from our team of specially trained Dire-Wolf Knights. So rude, intolerant, killjoys beware.
<br> <br>
            OUR MOTTO:<br>
           - In this life, we believe in magic,<br>
           - We have epic adventures,<br>
           - Once upon a time, and in a galaxy far far way.<br>
           - Going boldly where no one has gone before,<br>
           - dealing with all the Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey stuff.<br>
           - We know the answer to Life the Universe and Everything is 42,<br>
           - and that the odds are ever in our favor.<br>
           - We aim to misbehave, solemnly swear that we are up to no good,<br>
           - and we don't care what the Muggles think.<br>
           - Because in this life...<br>
           - We do Nerd, and we are PROUD OF IT!<br>
